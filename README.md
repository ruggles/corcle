Corcle is a teeny little game combining aspects of super hexagon and 2 cars.

It's super simple, block the dots with the same color paddle before they reach the center.

Control the white paddle with A and S, and the black paddle with K and L.

Requires Python 2.7 and Pygame, tested on Ubuntu 13.10 and Windows 7.
